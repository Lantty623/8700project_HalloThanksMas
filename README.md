# CPSC 8700 Project - HalloThanksMas

**HalloThanksMas** is a holiday-themed catching game built in Python. The game consists of three levels, each representing a different holiday theme: Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. Each level features a unique design for the catching container, items to catch, and increasing levels of difficulty.

## Overview

This game is part of the CPSC 8700 Software Design course project. Students were given the freedom to select their teammates and decide the game concept, programming language, and interface. The inspiration comes from the holiday season, where stores often sell combined decorations for Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas—referred to as *HalloThanksMas*. Hence, the game’s name reflects this theme.

## Game Details

- **Levels**: The game has three levels:
  - **Level 1**: Halloween-themed
  - **Level 2**: Thanksgiving-themed
  - **Level 3**: Christmas-themed
- Each level includes:
  - A uniquely designed catching container
  - Themed items to catch
  - Increasing levels of difficulty in catching items

## Project Requirements

The objective of the project is to design a simple game that combines all three holiday themes. The requirements include:

- Using **Python** or **C++** as the programming language
- Implementing at least **two design patterns** chosen by the team
- Creating a **simple interface** for gameplay
- Developing a **single-player** experience where:
  - The player can accumulate points across levels
  - The player has the option to **save and continue** the game
  - A **scoreboard** maintains player scores
